# 👋 Hi, I’m @Felipegalind0

[![](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Felipegalind0&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/Felipegalind0)

- 👀 I’m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry Applications, WebXR Development in  Babylon.js and more. 
- 🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion. I hate working with hardware, but I guess I'm good at that too. 
-  🙃I’m currently living in Minneapolis, and frankly I don't like it, Duluth is better. 
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I dropped a phone from the Golden Gate...
-  🇨🇴 I was born in Colombia and speak fluent spanish. 
-  🇺🇸 I live in the states so I speak English, duh
-  🇩🇪 My sister was learning French, I wanted to learn a third language to match her, and I met this cute girl who spoke german so i decided I was going to learn german and I did.(Sort of) 
- 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, please reach out to me.
- 👊🏻 If you're like me and you rely on Open Source Hardware and Software(literally everyone in the planet), unless you have a really good excuse you shoud make your projects Open Source.

- 🌲 We need to slowly, systematically, and carefully stop our reliance on non-renewable resources as a species. Climate change is real, if you deny it you haven't taken the time to read up on the science. It's also not realistic to stop using fossil fuels tomorrow, but not doing anything is the worst possible path. Business taxes are dumb, taxes on basic food items and groceries are too, not having a carbon tax is even dumber. 
-  💉 I'm not a doctor, but I do read up on science literature quite a bit. It really saddens me to see people refusing to take a life-saving preventative treatment that is statistically guaranteed to leave you with a better outcome than if you did not take a vaccine. Millions have taken these new treatments and the numbers are in. It is safest to get vaccinated. Please look at the data! It's a personal decision and nobody should be forced to take it, but if you don't you are acting irrationally while risking not only your life but also that of those around you. If everyone in the world had been vaccinated quickly it would have been much less likely that something like omicron would have popped up. 
- ✌🏻It's not cool to exclude people because of their nationality, language, religion, politics, vaccination status or anything else. Do not be an asshole, nobody benefits from that!
- 🙄 It's dumb to only have 2 political parties. I guess I'm a centrist. 
- 🛠 When I break my tech I will be the one to fix it and the same should be true for you! Do not buy products you can't thinker with or fix! To hell with Apple's, John Deere's, and others' consumerism division. I own what I buy.
