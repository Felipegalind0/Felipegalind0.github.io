- 👀 I’m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry Applications, WebXR Development in  Babylon.js and more. 
- 🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion. I hate working with hardware, but I guess I'm ok at that too. 
-  🙃I’m currently living in Minneapolis, and frankly I don't like it, Duluth is better. 
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I dropped a phone from the Golden Gate...
-  🇨🇴 I was born in Colombia and speak fluent spanish. 
-  🇺🇸 I live in the states so I speak English, duh
-  🇩🇪 My sister was learning French, I wanted to learn a third language to match her, and I met this cute girl who spoke german so i decided I was going to learn german and I did.(Sort of) 
- 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, please reach out to me.
- 👊🏻 If you're like me and you rely on Open Source Hardware and Software(literally everyone in the planet), you shoud make your projects Open Source. 
- 📖 I was working in a CS degree at UMN but they are broke and will only let me study for sticker price so probably switching schools.

#### 📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email. 

I've been working on a CS degree at UMN for the past two years, I went to Marshall School & Stanford Summer Session 2019. I’m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry, WebXR Development in Babylon.js and VR Develoment in general. I designed my own [Robot Dog](https://github.com/UMN-VR/GoldyDogV7), and made a hobby of CADing [360 camera attachments for a Drone](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/Insta360-Drone-Mount), an [Omnidirectional Robot](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/RONALD360), among other things. I'm an early adopter of imersive tech, ever since I got my Gear VR I always fly with a VR headset and Beat Saber keeps me in shape. Looking to use my part 107 licence for more productive stuff so [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) if you want to work with me! If you're an admissions officer plz [poach me](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) I can't aford UMN :( Looking for a Job at a company that aligns with my values and chalenges me to grow my skills, [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com).

- 🌲 We need to slowly, systematically, and carefully stop our reliance on non-renewable resources as a species. Climate change is real, if you deny it you haven't taken the time to read up on the science. It's also not realistic to stop using fossil fuels tomorrow, but not doing anything is the worst possible path. Business taxes are dumb, taxes on basic food items and groceries are too, not having a carbon tax is even dumber. 
-  💉 I'm not a doctor, but it really saddens me to see people refusing to take a life-saving preventative treatment that is statistically guaranteed to leave you with a better outcome than if you did not take a vaccine. Millions have taken these new treatments and the numbers are in. It is safest to get vaccinated. Please look at the data! It's a personal decision and nobody should be forced to take it, but if you don't you are acting irrationally while risking not only your life but also that of those around you. If everyone in the world had been vaccinated quickly it would have been much less likely that something like omicron would have popped up. 
- ✌🏻It's not cool to exclude people because of their nationality, language, religion, politics, vaccination status or anything else. Do not be an asshole, nobody benefits from that!
- 🙄 It's dumb to only have 2 political parties. I guess I'm a centrist. 
- 🛠 When I break my tech I will be the one to fix it and the same should be true for you! Do not buy products you can't thinker with or fix! To hell with Apple's, John Deere's, DJI's and others' consumerism division. I own what I buy, and I will get the schematics no matter what🖕🏻 
- 🇺🇦 It is not cool to pick on the small guy. If you do powers you can't comprehend will be unleashed against you.
