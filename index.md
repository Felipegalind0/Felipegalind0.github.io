HeyðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Galindo I'm a comercial drone pilot & I build & code robots. I've been working on a CS degree at UMN for the past two years, I went to Marshall School & Stanford Summer Session 2019. Iâ€™m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry, WebXR Development in Babylon.js and VR Develoment in general. I designed my own Robot Dog, and made a hobby of CADing 360 camera attachments for a Drone, an Omnidirectional Robot, among other things. I'm an early adopter of imersive tech, ever since I got my Gear VR I always fly with a VR headset and Beat Saber keeps me in shape. Looking to use my part 107 licence for more productive stuff so send me an email if you want to work with me!
