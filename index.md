- 👀 I’m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry Applications, 360 videography, WebXR Development in Babylon.js, Unity, ROS, Python, SwiftUI, cpp, Inverse Kinematics & more. 
-  🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion. I hate working with hardware, but I guess I'm ok at that too. 
-  🙃I’m currently living in Minneapolis, and frankly I don't like it, Duluth is better. 
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I dropped a phone from the Golden Gate, sometimes I'm not the brightest :/
-  🇨🇴 I was born in Colombia and speak fluent spanish. 
-  🇺🇸 I live in the states so I speak English, duh
-  🇩🇪 My sister was learning French, I wanted to learn a third language to match her, and I met this cute girl who spoke german so i decided I was going to learn german and I did.(Sort of) 
- 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, please reach out to me.
- 👊🏻 If you're like me and you rely on Open Source Hardware and Software(literally everyone in the planet), you shoud make your projects Open Source. 
- 📖 I was working in a CS degree at UMN but they are broke and will only let me study for sticker price so probably switching schools.

#### 📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email. 

I've been working on a CS degree at UMN for the past two years, I went to Marshall School & Stanford Summer Session 2019. I’m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry, WebXR Development in Babylon.js and VR Develoment in general. I designed my own [Robot Dog](https://github.com/UMN-VR/GoldyDogV7), and made a hobby of CADing [360 camera attachments for a Drone](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/Insta360-Drone-Mount), an [Omnidirectional Robot](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/RONALD360), among other things. I'm an early adopter of imersive tech, ever since I got my Gear VR I always fly with a VR headset and Beat Saber keeps me in shape. Looking to use my part 107 licence for more productive stuff so [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) if you want to work with me! If you're an admissions officer plz [poach me](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) I can't aford UMN :( Looking for a Job at a company that aligns with my values and chalenges me to grow my skills, [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com).

## Some of the things I have worked on:
