HeyðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Galindo I'm a comercial drone pilot & I build & code robots. 

I've been working on a CS degree at UMN for the past two years, I went to Marshall School & Stanford Summer Session 2019. Iâ€™m interested in Drones, Photogrammetry, WebXR Development in Babylon.js and VR Develoment in general. I designed my own [Robot Dog](https://github.com/UMN-VR/GoldyDogV7), and made a hobby of CADing [360 camera attachments for a Drone](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/Insta360-Drone-Mount), an [Omnidirectional Robot](https://github.com/Felipegalind0/RONALD360), among other things. I'm an early adopter of imersive tech, ever since I got my Gear VR I always fly with a VR headset and Beat Saber keeps me in shape. Looking to use my part 107 licence for more productive stuff so [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) if you want to work with me! If you're an admissions officer plz [poach me](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com) I can't aford UMN :( Looking for a Job at a company that aligns with my values and chalenges me to grow my skills, [send me an email](mailto:felipegalind0@outlook.com).
