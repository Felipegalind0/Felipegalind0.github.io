The Studiomdl Data file format (SMD) stores 3D models in ASCII for analysis and compilation by studiomdl. SMD files are usually generated by an SMD export plug-in for a given model editor package like MilkShape. Aside from Source and GoldSrc, SMD is known to be used by Sauerbraten and third party tools for The Sims and Mount & Blade.
