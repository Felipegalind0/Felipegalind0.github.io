The MD2 model file format was introduced by id Software when releasing Quake 2 in November 1997. It's a file format quite simple to use and understand. MD2 models' characteristics are these:
- Model's geometric data (triangles);
- Frame-by-frame animations;
- Structured data for drawing the model using GL_TRIANGLE_FAN and GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP primitives (called “OpenGL commands”).
