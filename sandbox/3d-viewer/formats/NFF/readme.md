The NFF (Neutral File Format) is designed as a minimal scene description language.  The language was designed in order to test various rendering algorithms and efficiency schemes.  It is meant to describe the geometry and basic surface characteristics of objects, the placement of lights, and the viewing frustum for the eye.  Some additional information is provided for esthetic reasons (such as the color of the objects, which is not strictly necessary for testing the efficiency of rendering algorithms).
